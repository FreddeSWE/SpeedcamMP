# SpeedcamMP
A BeamMP plugin that allows for the server to send messages to the chat when a speedcam is triggered.
Currently only for West_Coast_USA

## To-do
Add multiple-map functionality to allow for detection of maps with map-specific dictionaries
Add toggle-command to stop/allow server sending speedcam messages
Change output from chat to a UI pop-up for less chat-clogging
